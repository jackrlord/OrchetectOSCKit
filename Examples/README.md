# OSCKit Examples

These example projects are provided to demonstrate using OSCKit.

They will build for all platforms including macOS, iOS, tvOS and visionOS, and can be run in device simulators.

## Build Note

If Xcode builds but the app does not run, it may be because Xcode is defaulting to the wrong Scheme. Ensure the example app's Scheme is selected then try again.
