# OSCKit Basic Example

This example demonstrates the most essential features of OSCKit.

## Entitlements

If you are adding OSCKit to a macOS project that has the Sandbox entitlement, ensure that the network options are enabled. These entitlement options are already set in the example project.

## Build Note

> [!TIP]
> 
>If Xcode builds but the app does not run, it may be because Xcode is defaulting to the wrong Scheme. Ensure the example app's Scheme is selected then try again.
